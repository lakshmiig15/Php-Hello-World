## Dependency Management
During the deployment process Kinsta will automatically install dependencies defined in your `composer.json` file.

## Web Server Setup
Kinsta will automatically configure an apache web server which will serve from the main directory of the project in the usual fashion; create an `index.php` file in your project folder as the entry-point.
